[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

**Question:  Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?**

>> 1. Mean weight of first babies: 7.20 lb
>> 2. Mean weight of other babies 7.33 lb
>>
>> The difference in the mean weight of the two groups is: 0.125 lb or 2 oz. 
>> The first babies are on average lighter than the other babies. 

>> 3. Cohen d: 0.089
>>
>> The effect size for the birth weight between the two groups is more significant than that of the pregnancy length (Cohen d for pregnancy length is 0.0288.)
