Computing's interface is text. To work effectively, you need to be fluent with this interface.


## Typing

It may sound silly, but make sure you know how to type.  Take this [typing test](http://www.typingtest.com/). You should be comfortable typing with perfect accuracy at 60 words per minute, at least. If you currently can't, practice until you can.
