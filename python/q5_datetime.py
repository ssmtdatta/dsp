'''
Use Python to compute days between start and stop date.

Start and stop dates are given in three different string formats:
1. '01-02-2013' (month, day and year separated by -)
2. '12312013' (month, day and year separeted by null space)
3. '15-Jan-1994' (day, month and year separated by -.)

In all formats (1, 2 and 3):
day and year are given as zero-padded decimal numbers.

In formats 1 and 2:
months are given as zero-padded decimal numbers.

In format 3:
month as localeâ€™s abbreviated name.

The start_date and stop_date strings are converted to date object.
The the number of days between the dates is computed by takeing the difference 
between two date objects.
